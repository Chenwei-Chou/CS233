<Explain your team's strategy, implementation, etc.>

Here’s out strategies:

1.Two loops (loop and loop2) to handle different start position such that bot0 and bot1:
	Since we don’t know the start point is on the left or right, we load the x position of the bot before entering the loop and use branching to enter the body of the loop that we want.
	If the start point is on the left we enter the loop, and if the start point is on the right we enter the loop2.
	These two loops have different paths, so that we can handle different start position.

2. load water between every vertical direction change
	To make sure the bot have enough water to clean, we load water before every vertical direction change.
	This way of loading water makes sure we always have adequate water supply for use
	Our code use "next:" to gain the water.

3. use branch  to control movement
	Movement control is implemented using branching instructions to make the bot’s path based on its current position. 
	We have code chunks like "go_right", "go_left", "go_up", "go_down" to manually control its position for loop.
	And we use "ggo_right", "ggo_left", "ggo_up", "ggo_down" to manually control its position for loop2.
